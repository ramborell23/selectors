    <h1>Giant Pandas!</h1>

    <p>Giant pandas are bears that are native to China, where they are considered a national treasure. 
        Even with this exalted status, giant pandas are endangered: only about 1,600 live in the wild, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 
        About 100 live in zoos around the world.

        Size & descriptio
        <br/>
        Also called great pandas, parti-colored bears, bamboo bears and white bears, giant pandas are distinguished from other pandas by their large size and black-and-white coloring. 
        The bold coloring may provide camouflage, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo.  
        
        Giant pandas live up to their name. They are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. 
        (136 kilograms), according to the National Geographic, about the same as an American black bear. By comparison, 
        their distant relatives, red pandas, are only 20 to 26 inches (50 to 65 cm) tall and weigh 12 to 20 lbs. (5.4 to 9 kg).</p>
